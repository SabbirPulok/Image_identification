<h2 id="Dhaka">Full Moon</h2>
<img src="/home/sabbir/PycharmProjects/cd/templates/out4.jpg" alt="Full Moon" style="float:right; height:100px; width:100px">
<p>A full moon is the lunar phase that occurs when the Moon is completely illuminated as seen from Earth. This occurs when Earth is located directly between the Sun and the Moon (more exactly, when the ecliptic longitudes of the Sun and Moon differ by 180 degrees). This means that the hemisphere of the Moon that is facing Earth (the near side) is almost fully illuminated by the Sun and appears round (while the far side is almost completely unlit). When the full moon moves into Earth's shadow, a lunar eclipse occurs, and all or part of the Moon's face may appear reddish due to the Rayleigh scattering of blue light in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<h2 id="London">Gibbous_moon</h2>
<img src="/home/sabbir/PycharmProjects/cd/templates/gibbous_moon.jpg" alt="gibbous_moon" style="float:right; height:100px; width:100px">
<p>When the Sun and Moon are aligned on the same side of the Earth, the moon is "new", and the side of the Moon facing Earth is not illuminated by the Sun. As the moon waxes (the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth is increasing), the lunar phases progress through new moon, crescent moon, first-quarter moon, gibbous moon</p>

<h2 id="Tokyo">Half-Moon</h2>
<img src="/home/sabbir/PycharmProjects/cd/templates/halfmoon.jpeg" alt="Half-moon" style="float:right; height:100px; width:100px">
<p>Half Moon refers to the two lunar phases commonly known as first quarter and last quarter.
</p>

<h2 id="Paris">Crescent Moon</h2>
<img src="/home/sabbir/PycharmProjects/cd/templates/crescent_moon.jpg" alt="Crescent Moon" style="float:right; height:100px; width:100px">
<p>When a sphere is illuminated on one hemisphere and viewed from a different angle, the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two-dimensional shape defined by the intersection of an ellipse and circle (where the major axis of the ellipse coincides with a diameter of the circle). If the half-ellipse is convex with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be gibbous (bulging outwards)[2] whereas if the half-ellipse is concave with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be a crescent. When a crescent Moon occurs, the phenomenon of earthshine may be apparent, where the night side of the Moon faintly reflects light from the Earth.</p>
